Abstract:  
Migration to the U.S.-Mexico border is a phenomenon that has long been studied. However, the demographics of those arriving at the southwest border have changed over the last decade. Building on an existing agent-based model that simulates decision-making of Mexican citizens migrating to the U.S., this project adds migrants from Central America. This expanded ABM provides the opportunity to study the effects of border restrictions, willingness to migrate and risk aversion at the country level. Analyses reveal statistically significant differences between countries. The findings further indicate that varying levels of willingness to migrate and risk aversion have significant effects on migration. Overall, Mexico continues to have the highest percentage who migrate to the U.S.-Mexico border given its proximity and larger population density.
